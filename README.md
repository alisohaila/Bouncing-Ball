# Bouncing-Ball

This is the Bouncing Ball game made with Pygame. The purpose of this game is to prompt the user to customize their ball, such as the starting coordinates for x and y axises, speed of the ball, and the color of the ball from the 5 given options. Next, it will display their customized ball and a ball that is there by default and is mostly hard-coded. As any of the balls touch the edges of screen, it will bounce off to either of the directions. Lastly, if the two balls collide, they will completely stop moving and a message will be displayed in the console.
